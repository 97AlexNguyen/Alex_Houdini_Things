# Hou_snippet 

This is a tool for Houdini that allows to generate link to share snippets of nodes between users.
It allows to quickly generate snippet network of the nodes you wish to transfer, serialize them and store them on github gists. 
By sending the generated link or copying a link sent by another user you can serialize/deserialize the nodes from/to your houdini sessions. Allowing for an easy transfer of nodes/scenes between users.
A video demo of the tool is available here: https://vimeo.com/554680574
